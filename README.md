# Halo: Combat Evolved Disc Variant Information
To understand the differences between the different releases of Halo: Combat Evolved for the Xbox. Below are two tables tracking releases of the full game and of the demo for the Original Xbox. This repo will not concern itself with the Gearbox PC releases, the Xbox 360 Anniversary release, or the Master Chief Collection releases. As far as I can tell the higher level differences for the full game are whether or not there is a demos section and whether or not there are language specific versions of the maps that seemingly require the language to be set within the system's bios for them to be used. The version number comes from the MPF dump which should be parsed from the disc itself, so that seems like an important way to start grouping variants. Variant "Names" are just how I am going to refer to each variant in plain english. There are a ton of different releases even within a same region even excluding platinum hits/classics. Games can be exactly the same but the barcode is different (or sales not for resale), games can be exactly the same but one has the "Only On Xbox" logo with the other doesn't, etc. While I am not including the covers in this, as I bought all of these used and I know at least one disc was swapped out of its original case, I will be using cover variants in the naming of discs here. That means there can and will be rows below that are basically the exact same and you can easily tell that by seeing their full disc MD5 hash. The full scans link will link the archive.org items that correspond to the full game (disc and cover) I scanned and dumped as a part of this project. 

Eventually I will include ips file diffs of the default.xbe or demo.xbe file so people can take their copy of the game and compare it to other variants. I am almost certainly making minor mistakes in filling this out, so please let me know if something looks wrong or if I am incorrectly interpreting something (like what I am calling a disc, for instance).
